		<strong>The purpose of the project</strong>
		<br>We aim to create a service that distinguishes consumer characteristics among the recent MZ generation using the popular MBTI personality framework. However, a drawback is that accurately assessing consumer tendencies solely through personality-related questions is challenging. Furthermore, the current service does not extend to providing tailored offerings based on individual personality traits. To address these limitations, we drew inspiration from this service and propose leveraging KT telecommunication's big data platform, specifically utilizing BC card expenditure data. By employing this more precise criterion, we seek to categorize consumers more effectively and recommend cards with benefits tailored to each group.
		<br><br>
		<strong>The project offers several advantages</strong>
		<br>By understanding people's economic activities within segmented groups through the service and recommending cards accordingly, it provides a means for businesses to increase card enrollment rates and boost card usage. From the consumer's perspective, there is the benefit of gaining a clear understanding of their spending patterns and using a card tailored to their needs, thereby maximizing personal advantages.
